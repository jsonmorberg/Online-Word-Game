1) Declare/discuss any aspects of your client or server code that are not working.  What are your intuitions about why things are not working?  What issues you already tried and ruled out?  Given more time, what would you try next?  Detailed answers here are critical to getting partial credit for malfunctioning programs.

As far as we can tell everything seems to work. Timeout, game logic, multiple clients, and disconnecting clients all function as we want

2) Any assumptions you made for things not described in the specifications.

We assume that the server does not need to tell the second client that the first client has disconnected. We assume you don't need to correct for case. If the case is wrong, the answer is wrong because it is not in the dict. We also made it so the server prints out a little statment if a client disconnects even though this was not specified.

3) In a few sentences, describe how you tested that your code was working.
We Played multiple rounds of the game. Disconnected in different orders. Incrimetally built our project so each piece was working separately before we integrated it and beforehand made sure edge cases such as empty tries and round restarts were handled correctly. 
4) What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment, and why?
making sure the timeout was handled correctly because we had to block an input to stdin while using sockets. 
5) What variant/extension of this assignment would you like to try (e.g. a variant that is more powerful, more interesting, etc.)
make it so that the person who guesses a word first wins
